# Spacecraft Communications Workshop 

---

Welcome to this totally awesome repository, that is definetely going to make you telecommunication specialists in just a few hours!

After the presentation and some live demonstrations, the participants will split into two teams: one implementing the Spacecraft side and the other the Ground Station. For representativeness, the first team will make use of **C++** to code an **FSK modulator** and the latter will utulize **GNURadio** to implement an **FSK demodulator**. At first, the teams will act independently, testing their implementation with test data provided by us. Then, the teams will try to make their implementations to communicate, simulating an actual Satellite to Earth communication!

In the context of this workshop, you will need to install an IDE that supports C++ and CMake (preferably CLion, instructions below) and GNURadio. It is recommended to use a Linux operating system but not required. The steps you need to follow prior to attending the workshop (**Thessaloniki 19/12/22 17:00**, **Athens 20/12/22 17:00**) are the following:
